# Introduction #

Hi, I am __Ho Lee Lee__. I am engineering student who is admitted to CS major.

# Programming Languages #

I have learned these programming languages before.

*   Java
*   PHP
*   Javascript
*   html
*   css

# Faculty packages I have taken this year #

* [x] ENGG1110
* [x] ENGG1120
* [ ] ENGG1130 :(

So sad that I can't take ENGG1130 in this semester as I got F in MATH1510 in last semester. :(((((
I hope I can pass ENGG1120 in this semester.
